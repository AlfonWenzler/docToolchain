== docToolchain
==== create awesome docs!

_docToolchain_ is an implementation of the http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[_docs-as-code_] approach for software architecture.
The basis of docToolchain is the philosophy that software documentation should be treated in the same way as code together with the http://arc42.org[_arc42_] template for software architecture.

How it all began...

=== docs-as-code

Before this project started, I wasn't aware of the term _docs-as-code_. 
I just grew tired of keeping all my architecture diagrams up to date by copiing them from my UML tool over to my word processor.

As a lazy developer, I told myself 'there has to be a better way of doing this'.
And I started to automate the diagram export and switch from a full fledged word processor over to a markup renderer.
This enable me to reference the diagrams from within my text and update them just before I render the document.

=== arc42

Since my goal was to document software architectures, I was already using arc42 - a template for software architecture. 
At this time, it used the MS Word template.

But what is arc42? 

Dr. Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka created this template in a joint effort to create a standard for software architecture documents. 
The dumped all their experience about software architectures into not only a structure but also explaining texts.
These explanations are part of every chapter of the template and give you guidance on how to write each chapter of the document. 

arc42 is available in many formats like MS Word, textile and Confluence and all these formats are automatically generated from one _golden master_ which is formatted in http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[_asciidoc_].

=== docToolchain

In order to follow the _docs-as-code_ approach, you need a build script which automates steps like exporting diagrams and rendering the used markdown (_asciidoc_ in case of _docToolchain_) to the target format.

Unfortunatly, such a build script is not easy to create in the first place ('how do I create .docx?', 'why does lib x not work with lib y?') and it is also not too easy to maintain.

_docToolchain_ is the result of my journey through the _docs-as-code_ land. 
The goal is to have an easy to use build script which only has to be configured and not modified and which is maintained by a community as open source software.

The technical steps of my journey are written down in my blog: https://rdmueller.github.io .
